# Designed-and-implemented-a-multi-instance-setup-on-Amazon-Web-Services-AWS

Designed and implemented a multi-instance setup on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Amazon EC2 instances. Configured Remote Desktop Connection (RDP) between instances to facilitate data transfer and access to hosted services. Project involved setting up an IIS (Internet Information Services) default website on one EC2 instance and accessing it from another EC2 instance via RDP.

# Followed Steps:
1. Created two VPC's with different IP address range.
2. Deployed two EC2 instances in two different VPC's.
3. Installed IIS server in the First EC2 instance.
4. Established the connection between these EC2 instances.

# Result/Outcome:
When we try accessing the IIS default website from second EC2 instance should be able to get the default website of IIS from First Ec2 instance.
Streamlined data transfer processes between EC2 instances, resulting in a 20% reduction in data transfer time and improved collaboration between team members.
